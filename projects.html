					<span class="image main"><img src="images/vampirkoylu_logo.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Vampir Köylü is a browser based party game based on the children's game of the same name. <br> <br>
                    
                        At the start of the game a role will be picked for you from 3 options; Vampire, Wizard or Villager. 
                        And you will try and win the game by either killing the villagers and the wizard or by finding the vampires and executing them.

                        I have worked with a team of 4 people for about a year to realise this game. <br>

        			<h2 class="major">RunAndScore Game</h2>
					<p>Run And Score is a runner-type hyper-casual game that has been made in a week. <br> <br>
                    
                        This is my first ever Unreal Engine 5 project that I have finished. 
                        It uses very basic and starter assets in some places, however with the gameplay-loop and the other gimmicks, it feels like the finished product it is.

                        This was a personal project that I have developed in order to learn how to use Unreal Engine 5.
